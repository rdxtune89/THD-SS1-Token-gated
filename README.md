# THD Token-Gated Downloads

This repository hosts the **THD Token-Gated Downloads** page.

## Live Page
Once GitHub Pages is enabled in **Settings → Pages** with branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, you can access it at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<this-repo>/
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username, and `<this-repo>` with this repository's name.

## How It Works
- Connects to your crypto wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Checks if you own at least one NFT from the configured contract(s) on Polygon
- Unlocks exclusive download links for THD holders

## Files
- `index.html` – The token-gated downloads page
